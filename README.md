# College Python 101: Course Overview

Welcome to College Python 101, an introductory course designed to equip students with the foundational skills in Python programming. Over ten weeks, we will explore various aspects of Python, from basic syntax and data types to more complex concepts like loops, functions, and conditional expressions. Each week includes theoretical concepts, practical exercises, and mini-projects to help students apply what they've learned.

## Week 1: Input and Prints
- **Summary**: Introduction to Python's `input()` and `print()` functions. Students will learn how to get user input and display output.
- **Mini Exercise**: Greeting Program. Create a script that asks for the user's name and age, then prints a personalized greeting and tells them how old they will be in five years.

## Week 2: Floats and Types
- **Summary**: Understanding Python's basic data types, focusing on integers and floats. Exploration of type conversion and basic arithmetic operations.
- **Mini Project**: Calculator. Develop a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations and handles decimal numbers.

## Week 3: List Basics
- **Summary**: Introduction to lists in Python. Covering list creation, indexing, slicing, and basic list methods.
- **Mini Project**: Shopping List. Create a program that manages a shopping list, allowing the user to add, remove, and list items.

## Week 4: If-Else Branching
- **Summary**: Learning how to control the flow of a Python script with `if`, `else`, and `elif` statements.
- **Mini Project**: Adventure Game. Implement a simple text-based adventure game that changes outcomes based on user choices.

## Week 5: Loops
- **Summary**: Introduction to `for` and `while` loops in Python, including how to iterate over lists and use loop control statements.
- **Mini Project**: Number Guessing Game. Create a game where the user has to guess a random number within a certain number of attempts.

## Week 6: Nested Loops
- **Summary**: Understanding how to use loops within loops, and when they're useful.
- **Mini Project**: Pattern Printing. Write a program that prints out patterns (like stars or triangles) based on user input.

## Week 7: Functions Part 1
- **Summary**: Introduction to defining and calling functions. Understanding parameters, return values, and basic documentation.
- **Mini Project**: Personalized Greeting Card Generator. Design a function that creates personalized greeting messages.

## Week 8: Functions Part 2
- **Summary**: Diving deeper into functions with default parameter values, keyword arguments, and scope.
- **Mini Project**: Math Quiz. Develop a program that generates a series of math quizzes that adapt to the user's performance.

## Week 9: Computer Tour
- **Summary**: An exploratory week where we discuss how Python interacts with the computer. Covering file operations, directories, and basic scripts.
- **Mini Project**: File Organizer. Create a script that organizes files into folders based on file type or date.

## Week 10: Conditional Expressions
- **Summary**: Advanced use of conditions in Python, including conditional expressions and using conditions in list comprehensions.
- **Mini Project**: Customized Message Filter. Write a program that filters messages based on user-defined criteria.

Each week builds on the previous, gradually increasing in complexity. By the end of this course, students will have a solid understanding of Python basics and be prepared to tackle more advanced topics in programming.

Happy coding!
