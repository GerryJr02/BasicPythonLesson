Lesson 4: If-Else Branching

Objective:
Develop a simple text-based adventure game that presents the user with choices that influence the
 outcome of the game.

Instructions:
1. Start by describing the initial scenario to the user. Set the scene for your adventure game.
2. Present the user with a choice. Use input() to collect the user's decision.
3. Depending on the user's choice, branch the story into different paths using if, else, and elif
statements.
4. Include at least three decision points that lead to different outcomes. These can lead to
 success, failure, or anything in-between.
5. Ensure there's a clear end to each path with a message indicating the outcome of the game.

Notes:
- Focus on creating engaging and descriptive scenarios that draw the user into the game.
- Use your creativity to explore different story paths. The complexity of the story can vary based
 on your preference.
- Consider using functions to organize your code, especially if your adventure game grows in
 complexity.

Example Scenario:
You find yourself at the edge of a dark forest. Will you enter the forest or walk around it?
> enter
As you walk into the forest, you encounter a fork in the path. Do you go left or right?
> left
You've found a hidden treasure chest! Game over. You win!
