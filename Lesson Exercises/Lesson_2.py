Lesson 2: Floats and Types

Objective:
Develop a simple calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
 The calculator should be able to handle decimal numbers and display a result based on the
 operation chosen by the user.

Instructions:
1. Print a welcome message for the user.
2. Ask the user to enter the first number.
3. Ask the user to choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
4. Ask the user to enter the second number.
5. Perform the chosen operation with the two numbers.
6. Display the result in a user-friendly format.
7. Make sure to handle division by zero with an appropriate message.

Notes:
- Ensure the numbers entered by the user are converted to floats to allow decimal operations.
- Use if-else statements to process the user's choice of operation.
- Consider using try-except blocks to handle potential exceptions, such as division by zero.

Example Output:
Welcome to the simple calculator!
Enter the first number: 5.5
Choose an operation (+, -, *, /): *
Enter the second number: 2
Result: 5.5 * 2 = 11.0
