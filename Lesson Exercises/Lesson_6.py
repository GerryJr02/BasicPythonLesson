Lesson 6: Nested Loops

Objective:
Develop a program that uses nested loops to print a specific pattern based on the user's input size.
 The pattern will consist of numbers, creating a pyramid shape where each row contains increasing
  numbers from 1 up to the row number.

Instructions:
1. Ask the user for the size of the pattern (e.g., the height of the pyramid).
2. Use nested loops to print the pattern:
   - The outer loop should iterate from 1 to the user-specified size, inclusive.
   - The inner loop should print numbers starting from 1 up to the current number of the outer loop.
3. Ensure the pattern forms a pyramid shape, with each row's numbers increasing by one from the
 previous row.

Notes:
- This exercise focuses on understanding how nested loops work by using them to create a more
 complex pattern than in previous exercises.
- Consider how the relationship between the loops contributes to the pattern's structure.

Example Output:
Enter the size: 5
1
12
123
1234
12345
