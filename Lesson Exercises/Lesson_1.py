Lesson 1: Greeting Program

Objective:
Your task is to write a Python script that asks the user for their name and age. Then, it should
 print a greeting and a message telling the user how old they will be in 5 years.

Instructions:
1. Use the input() function to collect the user's name. Display the prompt: "What is your name? ".
2. Use the input() function again to collect the user's age. Display the prompt: "How old are you? "
3. Convert the age from a string to an integer.
4. Calculate the age of the user in 5 years.
5. Print a greeting to the user using their name.
6. Print a message telling the user how old they will be in 5 years.

Notes:
- Make sure to include error handling for the age conversion. Assume the user always enters a valid
 integer for their age.
- Use meaningful variable names and follow Python naming conventions.

Example Output:
If the user inputs "Alice" for the name and "30" for the age, the output should be:
Hello Alice, nice to meet you!
In 5 years, you will be 35 years old.
