Lesson 7: Functions Part 1

Objective:
Develop a program with a function that generates personalized greeting messages based on user input.
 This function should accept parameters for the person's name and the occasion, and return a
  customized greeting message.

Instructions:
1. Define a function named `create_greeting` that takes two parameters: `name` and `occasion`.
2. Inside the function, use the parameters to craft a personalized greeting message.
3. The function should return the greeting message as a string.
4. After defining the function, prompt the user for their name and the occasion.
5. Call the `create_greeting` function with the user's inputs, and print the returned greeting
 message.

Notes:
- This exercise introduces the concept of functions, parameters, and return values in Python.
- Use docstrings to document the purpose of the function and its parameters.

Example Output:
Enter your name: Alice
Enter the occasion: Birthday
Happy Birthday, Alice! Wishing you all the best on your special day!
