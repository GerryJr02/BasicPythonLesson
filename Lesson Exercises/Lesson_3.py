Lesson 3: List Basics

Objective:
Develop a program that manages a shopping list. The program should allow the user to add items,
 remove items, and display the current list of items.

Instructions:
1. Start with an empty list that will serve as the shopping list.
2. Display a menu to the user with the following options: Add item, Remove item, Show list, and Quit
3. Implement the functionality for adding items to the list. If an item is already in the list,
 inform the user.
4. Implement the functionality for removing items from the list. If the item is not in the list,
 inform the user.
5. Implement the functionality to display the current list of items.
6. Allow the user to quit the program.

Notes:
- Use a while loop to continuously display the menu until the user decides to quit.
- Use if-else statements to process the user's menu choice.
- When adding or removing items, consider case sensitivity. You may choose to normalize case to
 make the shopping list case-insensitive.

Example Interaction:
What would you like to do?
Options: Add, Remove, Show, Quit
> Add
What item would you like to add?
> Apples
Apples added to the shopping list.

What would you like to do?
Options: Add, Remove, Show, Quit
> Show
Shopping List:
- Apples
