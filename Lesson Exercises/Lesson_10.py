Lesson 10: Conditional Expressions

Objective:
Develop a program that filters messages based on user-defined criteria. The program will allow the
 user to input a list of messages and define filters (e.g., messages containing specific words or
  phrases) to apply to this list, using conditional expressions and list comprehensions.

Instructions:
1. Prompt the user to enter a series of messages, separated by a specific delimiter (e.g., a comma).
2. Ask the user for the filter criteria (e.g., a word or phrase to look for in the messages).
3. Use a list comprehension with a conditional expression to filter out messages that meet the
 user's criteria.
4. Print the filtered list of messages.
5. Optionally, allow the user to apply multiple filters by repeating steps 2-4.

Notes:
- This exercise introduces conditional expressions in a practical application, showing how they can
 simplify tasks like filtering data.
- Encourage exploration of multiple conditional expressions and their use in list comprehensions
 for more complex filtering logic.

Example Output:
Enter your messages (separated by commas): Hello there, Good morning, Have a nice day, Hello
Enter a word to filter messages by: Hello
Filtered messages: ['Hello there', 'Hello']
