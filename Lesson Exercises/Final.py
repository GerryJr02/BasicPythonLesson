Personal Finance Manager (PFM) - Final Project

Project Description:
Develop a Personal Finance Manager program that enables users to track their expenses and income,
categorize transactions, and gain basic financial insights through a command-line interface.

Core Features:
1. Transaction Recording: Input income and expenses with details (amount, category, date).
2. Data Storage: Transactions are saved to a file for persistence across sessions.
3. Transaction Viewing: View transactions filtered by type (income/expense) or category.
4. Financial Summary: Display a summary including total income, expenses, and net savings for the
 current month.
5. Budget Setting and Alerting: Set monthly budgets for categories and get alerts when nearing
 budget limits.

Technical Requirements:
- Organize code using functions for each core feature.
- Implement error handling for user inputs and file operations.
- Use list comprehensions and conditional expressions for data processing.
- Practice file I/O by storing transaction data in a CSV format.

Suggested Steps:
1. Design: Outline your application structure, including the necessary functions, data storage
  method, and user interaction flow.
2. Implementation: Start coding your application feature by feature, ensuring each works before
 moving on.
3. Testing: Conduct thorough testing with various inputs and scenarios to ensure robustness and
 reliability.
4. Iteration: Refine and enhance your application based on testing feedback.

Deliverables:
- Source Code: A .py file containing your application's code.
- Documentation: A README file detailing how to run your application, feature descriptions,
 and setup instructions.
- Demo (Optional): A demonstration (video or written guide) of your application in action.

This project is a comprehensive application of the skills you've acquired in this course.
 It's an opportunity to create something functional and practical that consolidates your learning
 and prepares you for future Python projects.

Good luck, and happy coding!
